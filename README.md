# Aircraft-detection-using-SAR-images
This project focuses on **automated aircraft detection** using **Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images** by leveraging the powerful **YOLOv8** object detection model. SAR images, known for their ability to penetrate clouds and operate in all weather conditions, provide an ideal dataset for remote sensing-based aircraft monitoring systems.
##  Objective
To build a robust and accurate deep learning model capable of detecting aircraft from SAR images in real-time using the YOLOv8 architecture.
We utilize **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8)** from Ultralytics for object detection due to its:
- High accuracy and speed
- Advanced CNN-based architecture
- Support for training on custom datasets
- Easy deployment in edge and cloud environments
